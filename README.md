# ResumableSymfony
Adaptation of Resumable.js for Symfony with javascript based of <a href="https://github.com/23/resumable.js/">Resumable.js</a> but very heavily rewritten.  

Javascript part includes previews and file type recognition.
You can have several independent uploaders on a page and module is customizable for several different scenarios.
